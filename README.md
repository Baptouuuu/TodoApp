TodoApp
=======

This todo application is an equivalent of the Wunderkit project (since it's discontinued by 6Wunderkinder), only working in the browser; the social dimension is not present here. Since all the code is run in the browser, it can still work when the user is offline thanks to HTML5 AppCache.

It's based on HTML5 APIs such as Indexed DB for data persistance.

You can see it working at this address: http://projects.baptiste-langlade.com/TodoApp/

## Requirements

HTML5 APIs:
* Indexed DB
* localStorage
* datasets
* querySelector function

It has been tested with Chrome 21+ and Firefox 15+
